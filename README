This file is designed to export the files that were modified or added between two svn revisions.
It will create a corresponding zip file with the directory structure intact. 
Useful for when the server you are pushing to doesn't have access to your repository.

-- Recommendations
	It is reccomended that you set this to executable and add it to your path in your .profile 
	(otherwise you will have to copy it to each repo)

-- Requirements
	OSX is not required but, it is a requirement that svn and zip are installed in the OS.

	Example:
		cd [/repo_root]
		export_changes.rb 1550:1560

	Produces:
		1550_1560.zip [saved to ~/Desktop]
